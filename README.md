# Sending And Storing Transactions Web 3.0 App 

This is my first web 3.0 app that i created using React js for front-end development, Solidity to connect with the blockchain and GIF API to use gifs.<br/>
In <strong><ins>React JS</ins></strong>, i used:
<ul>
  <li>React Components</li>
  <li>
    React Hooks
    <ul>
      <li>useEffect Hook</li>
      <li>useState Hook</li>
      <li>useContext Hook</li>
      <li>I created my own hook and used it too !</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Context API</li>
</ul>
<strong><ins>Solidity</ins></strong> helped me to create a smart contract that contain different methodes such addToBlockchain() method which store transactions and
some informations about them into the blockchain, getAllTransactions() method to fetch all the transactions from the blockchain and display them into my app.
<br/><br/>
